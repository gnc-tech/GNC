### Overview

The JDSJ18TK01 series quartz flexure accelerometer is a miniaturized, high-precision, large-range inertial navigation-grade accelerometer known for its excellent long-term stability, repeatability, startup performance, environmental adaptability, and high reliability. It is suitable for both static and dynamic testing and also functions as a standard vibration and tilt sensor. The product features a unique miniaturized design and packaging process, with output current linearly related to the applied force or acceleration. Users can calculate and select appropriate sampling resistors to achieve high-precision output. Additionally, a temperature sensor can be integrated upon user request to compensate for bias and scale factor, reducing the impact of environmental temperature variations.
