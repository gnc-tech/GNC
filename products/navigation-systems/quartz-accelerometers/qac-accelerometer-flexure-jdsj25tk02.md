### Overview

The JDSJ25TK02 series quartz flexure accelerometer is a high-precision, high-range inertial navigation-grade accelerometer (up to 100g). It boasts excellent long-term stability, repeatability, startup performance, environmental adaptability, and high reliability. Suitable for both static and dynamic testing, it also functions as a standard vibration and tilt sensor. The accelerometer's output current maintains a linear relationship with the applied force or acceleration, allowing users to select appropriate sampling resistors to achieve high-precision outputs. Additionally, an internal temperature sensor can be integrated upon request to compensate for bias and scale factor variations, thereby minimizing environmental temperature influences.
