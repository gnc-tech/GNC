### Overview

The **CGM300S10** is a tactical-grade MEMS Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) that combines high-performance gyroscopes, accelerometers, and inclinometers in a compact, rugged design. Featuring in-run gyro bias stability down to **0.05¬∞/hr** and angular random walk as low as **0.02¬∞/‚àöhr**, it is built to meet the demands of high-precision navigation and control systems.

Its robust RS422 interface, small form factor, and wide operating temperature range make it an ideal solution for UAVs, robotics, surveying platforms, and autonomous vehicles. As a fully STIM300-compatible IMU, the CGM300S10 offers seamless integration for both new designs and system upgrades.
