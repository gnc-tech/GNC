### Features

- Wide range of capacities from 50 As to 60000 As
- Fast activation time (0.5s - 2.5s)
- Long operating duration capability
- Multiple working current profiles
- Compact and efficient design
- Reliable performance

### Applications

- Power supply for guidance systems
- Emergency power backup
- Military applications
- High-current pulse applications
- Portable power solutions

### Notes

1. Operating temperature range: -40¬∞C to +70¬∞C (for high-temperature thermal batteries, the operating temperature can reach up to +450¬∞C);
2. Pulse capability refers to the maximum current amplitude the battery can withstand, which is typically applied at the initial stage of operation after the thermal battery is fully activated;
3. As the voltage range of the thermal battery is broadened, its capacity can be further increased.
