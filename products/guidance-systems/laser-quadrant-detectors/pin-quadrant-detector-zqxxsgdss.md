# Z-Q-XXSGDSS Single-Tube PIN Quadrant Detector

> **Quick Answer**: The ZQXXSGDSS series is a high-performance single-tube PIN quadrant detector designed for precise laser beam positioning and tracking. It features an integrated four-quadrant design with a spectral response range from 400 to 1150 nm, a peak response wavelength of 980 nm, and exceptional sensitivity for demanding optical measurement systems.

## What is Z-Q-XXSGDSS?

The **ZQXXSGDSS** series single-tube PIN quadrant detectors integrate four photosensitive quadrants into a single package, allowing for accurate positioning and tracking of laser beams. Operating under reverse bias conditions, these detectors have a spectral response range that covers both visible light and near-infrared wavelengths, peaking at 980 nm and showing enhanced response at 1064 nm. The compact single-tube design ensures minimal gap between quadrants, offering excellent consistency and performance for optical measurement applications.
