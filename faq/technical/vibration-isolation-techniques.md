# Vibration Isolation Techniques for Precision Inertial Sensors

> **Quick Answer:** Effective vibration isolation for inertial sensors requires understanding the vibration environment, selecting appropriate isolation materials (elastomers, wire rope, pneumatic), designing for proper isolation frequency (<1/3 excitation frequency), and balancing isolation effectiveness with system stiffness requirements.

## 🔧 Vibration Isolation Fundamentals

### Why Vibration Isolation is Critical

Precision inertial sensors are extremely sensitive to mechanical disturbances. Even small vibrations can cause:

- **Bias Errors:** Vibration rectification effects
- **Noise Increase:** Reduced signal-to-noise ratio
- **Scale Factor Errors:** Non-linear response to acceleration
- **Mechanical Damage:** Fatigue failure of sensitive components
- **Performance Degradation:** Reduced accuracy and stability

### Basic Isolation Principles

#### Single-Degree-of-Freedom System
```
Transmissibility (T) = 1 / √[(1 - r²)² + (2ζr)²]

Where:
r = f/fn (frequency ratio)
f = excitation frequency
fn = natural frequency of isolation system
ζ = damping ratio
```

**Key Design Rules:**
- **Isolation begins when r > √2 (approximately 1.4)**
- **Maximum isolation when r >> 1**
- **Optimal damping: ζ = 0.1 to 0.3**
