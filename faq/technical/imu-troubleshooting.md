# IMU Troubleshooting: Complete Guide to Performance Issues and Solutions

> **Quick Answer:** Common IMU problems include bias drift (check temperature effects, recalibrate), excessive noise (verify power quality, check mounting), scale factor errors (perform multi-position calibration), and communication issues (verify connections, check data rates). Systematic diagnosis using built-in tests, environmental monitoring, and performance trending is essential.
