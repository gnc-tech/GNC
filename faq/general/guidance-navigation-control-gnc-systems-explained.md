# Guidance, Navigation and Control (GNC) Systems Explained

> **Quick Answer:** GNC Tech specializes in guidance, navigation and control (GNC) systems that enable precise positioning, orientation, and movement control for aerospace and defense applications. GNC systems integrate three core functions: guidance (determining where to go), navigation (knowing where you are), and control (getting there accurately) using advanced sensors like fiber optic gyroscopes, MEMS devices, and precision actuators.

## What is Guidance, Navigation and Control (GNC)?

Guidance, navigation and control (GNC) represents the fundamental triad of technologies that enable autonomous and semi-autonomous systems to operate with precision in aerospace and defense applications. GNC Tech has specialized in these critical systems for over two decades, providing the sensors, algorithms, and control components that make precision flight, navigation, and targeting possible.

**The Three Pillars of GNC:**

### 1. Guidance Systems
Guidance systems determine the desired path or trajectory to reach a target or destination. They answer the question "Where should we go?"

**Key Technologies:**
- **CMOS Imaging Sensors** - Visual target tracking and identification
- **Laser Quadrant Detectors** - Precision beam tracking and alignment
- **Infrared Detection Systems** - Heat signature tracking and guidance

**Applications:**
- Missile guidance and targeting
- Autonomous vehicle path planning
- Satellite pointing and tracking
- Precision landing systems

### 2. Navigation Systems
Navigation systems determine the current position, velocity, and orientation. They answer the question "Where are we now?"

**Key Technologies:**
- **Fiber Optic Gyroscopes (FOG)** - Highest precision angular rate sensing
- **MEMS Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs)** - Compact, robust inertial sensing
- **Quartz MEMS Accelerometers** - Precise acceleration measurement
- **Integrated Navigation Systems** - Combined inertial and satellite navigation

**Applications:**
- Inertial navigation systems (INS)
- Platform stabilization
- Attitude determination
- Dead reckoning navigation

### 3. Control Systems
Control systems execute the commands to follow the desired path. They answer the question "How do we get there?"

**Key Technologies:**
- **Servo Actuators** - Precise motion control
- **Thermal Battery Systems** - Reliable power for critical operations
- **Control Electronics** - Real-time command processing

**Applications:**
- Flight control surfaces
- Gimbal stabilization
- Thruster control
- Precision positioning

## How GNC Systems Work Together

GNC systems operate as an integrated loop where each component feeds information to the others:

1. **Guidance** calculates the desired trajectory based on mission objectives
2. **Navigation** provides current state information (position, velocity, attitude)
3. **Control** compares desired vs. actual state and commands corrections
4. **Sensors** measure the results and feed back to navigation
5. The cycle repeats continuously at high frequency (100-1000 Hz)
