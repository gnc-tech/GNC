# FOG vs MEMS Gyroscopes: Complete Technology Comparison

> **Quick Answer:** FOG (Fiber Optic Gyroscopes) offer superior precision and stability for high-end navigation applications, while MEMS gyroscopes provide compact, cost-effective solutions for consumer and industrial applications. The choice depends on your precision requirements, size constraints, and budget.

## 🔍 Technology Overview

### Fiber Optic Gyroscopes (FOG)
Fiber optic gyroscopes use the **Sagnac effect** in optical fibers to measure rotation. Light travels in opposite directions through a coiled optical fiber, and rotation causes a phase shift that's proportional to the angular velocity.

**Key Advantages:**
- Highest precision and stability
- No moving parts (solid-state)
- Excellent long-term stability
- Wide dynamic range
- Immune to electromagnetic interference

### MEMS Gyroscopes
MEMS (Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems) gyroscopes use microscopic vibrating structures to detect rotation through the **Coriolis effect**. When the sensor rotates, the vibrating mass experiences a force perpendicular to both the vibration and rotation axes.

**Key Advantages:**
- Compact size and lightweight
- Low power consumption
- Cost-effective for volume production
- High shock and vibration resistance
- Fast startup time
