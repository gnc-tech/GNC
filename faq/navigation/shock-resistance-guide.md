# Shock Resistance Guide: Protecting Inertial Sensors in High-Impact Environments

> **Quick Answer:** Shock resistance varies by sensor technology: MEMS sensors handle 1,000-10,000g, Quartz MEMS withstand 5,000-50,000g, while FOG systems typically survive 100-1,000g. Key factors include pulse duration (0.1-11ms), mounting design, and protection mechanisms. Military applications require MIL-STD-810 Method 516 compliance.

## üõ°Ô∏è Shock Resistance Fundamentals

### Understanding Shock Environments

Shock is a sudden acceleration or deceleration that can damage sensitive inertial sensors. Unlike vibration, shock events are:

- **Transient:** Short duration (microseconds to milliseconds)
- **High Amplitude:** Often exceeding normal operating accelerations
- **Non-Repetitive:** Single events or infrequent occurrences
- **Directional:** Can occur in any axis or combination of axes

### Shock Damage Mechanisms

#### Mechanical Failure Modes
```
Structural Damage:
- Proof mass fracture or detachment
- Spring element failure
- Wire bond breakage

Functional Degradation:

- Increased noise levels
- Reduced sensitivity
```

#### Failure Thresholds by Technology
| Technology | Typical Shock Limit | Failure Mode | Recovery |
|------------|-------------------|--------------|----------|
| **MEMS** | 1,000-10,000g | Mechanical fracture | Usually permanent |
