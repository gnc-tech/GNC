# How to Select the Right IMU for Navigation Applications

> **Quick Answer:** IMU selection depends on your precision requirements, environmental conditions, size constraints, and budget. Navigation-grade applications need FOG-based IMUs, tactical applications use Quartz MEMS, and commercial applications typically use MEMS IMUs.

## üéØ IMU Selection Decision Framework

### Step 1: Define Your Requirements

#### Performance Requirements
- **Precision Level:** What bias stability do you need?
  - Navigation Grade: <0.01¬∞/h (FOG required)
  - Tactical Grade: 0.1-1¬∞/h (Quartz MEMS recommended)
  - Industrial Grade: 1-10¬∞/h (MEMS suitable)
  - Commercial Grade: >10¬∞/h (Low-cost MEMS)

- **Dynamic Range:** What rotation rates must be measured?
  - Low: ¬±100¬∞/s (precision applications)
  - Medium: ¬±1000¬∞/s (general navigation)
  - High: ¬±4000¬∞/s (high-dynamics applications)

#### Environmental Requirements
- **Operating Temperature:** What temperature range?
  - Standard: -40¬∞C to +70¬∞C
  - Extended: -55¬∞C to +85¬∞C
  - Extreme: Custom temperature ranges

- **Shock and Vibration:** What mechanical stress levels?
  - Low: <100g shock (laboratory/marine)
  - Medium: 100-1000g shock (automotive/industrial)
  - High: >10,000g shock (military/aerospace)

#### Physical Constraints
- **Size Limitations:** Available space for IMU
- **Weight Restrictions:** Mass budget constraints
- **Power Budget:** Available electrical power
- **Interface Requirements:** Communication protocols needed

### Step 2: Technology Selection Matrix

| Application Type | Recommended Technology | Typical Products | Key Benefits |
|------------------|----------------------|------------------|--------------|
| **Submarine Navigation** | FOG-based IMU | Navigation-grade systems | Highest precision, long-term stability |
| **Aircraft INS** | FOG or Quartz MEMS | Tactical/Navigation grade | High accuracy, proven reliability |
| **Platform Stabilization** | FOG or Quartz MEMS | Tactical-grade systems | Excellent stability, low noise |
| **Autonomous Vehicles** | Quartz MEMS or MEMS | Tactical/Industrial grade | Good performance, reasonable cost |
| **Robotics** | MEMS | Industrial-grade systems | Compact, low power, cost-effective |
| **Consumer Electronics** | MEMS | Commercial-grade systems | Very compact, ultra-low power |
