# Fiber Optic Gyroscope (FOG) Selection Guide

> **Quick Answer:** FOG selection depends on your precision requirements, environmental conditions, and application constraints. Navigation-grade FOGs offer the highest precision (<0.01¬∞/h) for critical applications, while tactical-grade FOGs provide excellent performance for most aerospace and defense needs.

## üî¨ FOG Technology Overview

### How Fiber Optic Gyroscopes Work
Fiber optic gyroscopes utilize the **Sagnac effect** to measure rotation:
1. **Light Source:** Laser light (typically 1550nm) is generated
2. **Beam Splitting:** Light is split into two counter-propagating beams
3. **Fiber Coil:** Beams travel through a coiled optical fiber
4. **Phase Detection:** Rotation causes phase shift between beams
5. **Signal Processing:** Phase difference is converted to rotation rate

### Key FOG Components
- **Light Source:** Broadband ASE source or laser diode
- **Fiber Coil:** Single-mode optical fiber (100m to 5km+ length)
- **Integrated Optic Chip (IOC):** Beam splitting and modulation
- **Photodetector:** Phase difference measurement
- **Signal Processing Electronics:** Digital signal processing and output
