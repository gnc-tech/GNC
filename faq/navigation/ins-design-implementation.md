# Inertial Navigation System (INS) Design and Implementation Guide

> **Quick Answer:** INS design requires selecting appropriate inertial sensors (FOG for highest precision, Quartz MEMS for tactical applications), implementing proper navigation algorithms (Kalman filtering), and integrating with external references (GPS) for optimal performance. System architecture depends on precision requirements, mission duration, and environmental conditions.

## 🧭 INS Fundamentals

### What is an Inertial Navigation System?
An Inertial Navigation System (INS) is a self-contained navigation system that uses:
- **Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU)** - Measures acceleration and angular velocity
