# Accelerometer Calibration for Aerospace: Complete Procedure Guide

## 🚀 Why is aerospace accelerometer calibration critical?

Aerospace applications require high accuracy and reliability from accelerometers due to their mission-critical nature and extreme operating conditions. This calibration ensures that performance specifications meet stringent industry standards.

## 📊 What are the key performance specifications for accelerometers?

Key specifications include bias stability of less than 10 μg for navigation grade, scale factor accuracy of less than 100 ppm, and cross-axis sensitivity of less than 0.1% of full scale for precision applications. These parameters are crucial for ensuring reliable operation.

## 🔧 What calibration equipment is essential for accelerometer calibration?

Essential equipment includes multi-axis rate tables with angular accuracy of ±1 arcsecond, linear motion simulators with an acceleration range of ±50g, and precision accelerometers with 10× better accuracy than the device under test. Each piece plays a vital role in achieving accurate calibration.

## 🌡️ How is environmental control managed during calibration?

Environmental control is maintained using temperature chambers that range from -65°C to +125°C with stability of ±0.1°C. Vibration isolation systems are also used to minimize disturbances during the calibration process.

## 📋 What are the steps involved in the pre-calibration preparation?

Pre-calibration involves physical inspection of the device, electrical verification of power supply and signal conditioning, and environmental stabilization through temperature soak time of at least 4 hours. Proper documentation of these steps is also essential.

## 📏 How is bias determined during calibration?

Bias determination involves a six-position test where the accelerometer is placed in various orientations to measure static bias. The average of readings from each position is calculated to determine the bias for each axis.

## ⚖️ What is the procedure for scale factor calibration?

Scale factor calibration entails applying known accelerations across the full scale range and measuring the output to calculate the scale factor. Linear regression analysis is used to assess the linearity of the output.

## 🔄 How is cross-axis sensitivity tested?

Cross-axis sensitivity is tested by applying known acceleration to a primary axis while monitoring the outputs on orthogonal axes. This helps quantify the degree of cross-coupling that may occur between axes.

## 🌡️ What methods are used for temperature compensation calibration?

Temperature compensation involves multi-temperature testing at defined intervals across the operational range, followed by calculating temperature coefficients for bias and scale factor. A polynomial compensation model may be developed for accurate output correction.

## 📊 How is data analysis and validation performed?

Data analysis includes assessing measurement uncertainty from various sources and validating calibration through independent verification using alternative setups. Field testing is also conducted to ensure long-term stability.

## 📜 What documentation is required for calibration records?

Calibration records must include detailed test procedures, environmental conditions, equipment used, raw data, analysis results, and acceptance criteria. This documentation is crucial for maintaining traceability and quality assurance.

## 🔗 What are the traceability requirements for calibration?

Traceability requires a calibration chain that includes primary standards from national metrology institutes, secondary standards from accredited labs, and working standards for in-house reference equipment. This ensures the integrity of calibration processes.

## 📚 Where can additional resources for calibration be found?

Additional resources include standards such as MIL-STD-810 for environmental testing, IEEE 1293 for accelerometer calibration specifications, and ISO 16063 for vibration and shock transducers. These documents provide essential guidelines for best practices in calibration.

## 📞 How can one consult for specific calibration services?

For specific calibration services or custom procedures, it is recommended to consult with GNC Tech's metrology team. They can provide tailored solutions based on the demanding requirements of aerospace applications.
