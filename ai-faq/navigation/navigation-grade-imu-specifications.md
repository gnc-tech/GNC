# Navigation-Grade IMU Specifications: Complete Selection Guide

## What are the key performance parameters of navigation-grade IMUs?

Navigation-grade IMUs require exceptional performance, including bias stability of less than 0.01°/h and angular random walk of less than 0.001°/√h. These parameters ensure high accuracy for applications that do not rely on external reference updates.

## What are the gyroscope performance requirements for navigation-grade IMUs?

Gyroscope requirements include bias stability of less than 0.01°/h, scale factor stability under 10 ppm, and angular random walk below 0.001°/√h. Misalignment between axes should also be less than 10 arcseconds to maintain precision.

## What are the accelerometer performance requirements?

For accelerometers, bias stability must be less than 10 μg, with a velocity random walk under 0.001 m/s/√h. Additionally, scale factor stability and nonlinearity need to be below 10 ppm, and cross-axis sensitivity should be less than 100 ppm.

## How are navigation-grade IMUs classified?

IMUs are classified into Strategic, Navigation, Tactical, and Industrial grades, with bias stability ranging from less than 0.001°/h for strategic systems to 1-10°/h for industrial applications. Costs and mission durations vary significantly across these categories.

## What are the advantages of Fiber Optic Gyroscope (FOG) based systems?

FOG-based systems offer excellent long-term stability, with bias stability ranging from 0.001-0.01°/h. They are suitable for strategic and navigation-grade applications, although they can be costly, ranging from $50K to $500K per axis.

## What are the characteristics of Quartz MEMS navigation-grade IMUs?

Quartz MEMS systems have a bias stability of 0.01-0.1°/h and are compact and shock-resistant. They are more affordable, with costs ranging from $10K to $100K per IMU, making them suitable for tactical to navigation-grade systems.

## How is bias stability measured in navigation-grade IMUs?

Bias stability is measured using Allan variance analysis over 1-10 hours and through temperature cycling tests. This metric is crucial for determining long-term stability and directly impacts position drift rates.

## What are the environmental specifications for navigation-grade IMUs?

Navigation-grade IMUs operate within a temperature range of -40°C to +70°C for standard models, with extended versions capable of -55°C to +85°C. They must withstand operational shocks of 100-500g and vibrations of 10g RMS across a frequency range of 20Hz to 2kHz.

## What are the physical and electrical specifications for these IMUs?

FOG-based systems typically measure 10-50 cm³ per axis and consume between 5-50W. Quartz MEMS systems are smaller, at 1-10 cm³ total, with power requirements of 1-10W and a startup time of 1-30 minutes for full accuracy.

## What are the critical requirements for Inertial Navigation Systems (INS)?

INS requires bias stability of less than 0.01°/h for effective drift control, along with high reliability and long-term stability. FOG-based systems are recommended for primary navigation, while Quartz MEMS can serve as backups.

## What are the best practices for selecting navigation-grade IMUs?

Best practices include defining navigation accuracy requirements, allocating error budgets, and comparing technologies like FOG and Quartz MEMS. Avoid over-specifying or under-specifying based on mission needs and environmental conditions.

## What types of testing are required for navigation-grade IMUs?

Testing includes Allan variance analysis, temperature cycling, and long-term stability monitoring. Environmental tests for shock, vibration, and EMI/EMC compliance are also essential to ensure robust performance.

## How can one contact an expert for navigation-grade IMU selection?

For assistance, you can reach out through a technical consultation or use an interactive product selection tool available on the provider's website. Requesting a quote can also help in understanding pricing for recommended systems.

## What common mistakes should be avoided during IMU selection?

Common mistakes include over-specifying navigation-grade IMUs when tactical-grade is sufficient and failing to consider integration complexities. It's also important to ensure adequate environmental testing and interface specifications are included.

## What is the significance of scale factor accuracy in IMUs?

Scale factor accuracy refers to the proportionality between input rate and output signal, with required stability and nonlinearity metrics. Accurate scale factors ensure reliable performance across varying operating conditions.

## What is the impact of angular random walk (ARW) on IMU performance?

Angular random walk impacts short-term measurement precision, affecting attitude accuracy. It is critical for high-bandwidth applications, making it a key specification in navigation-grade IMUs.
