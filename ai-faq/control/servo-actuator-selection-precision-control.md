# Servo Actuator Selection Criteria for Precision Control Systems

## What are the main types of servo actuators for precision control?

There are two primary types: linear servo actuators that provide precise straight-line motion with forces from 200N to 3000N, and rotary servo actuators that deliver angular positioning with torque outputs from 1.2 N·m to 50 N·m. Linear actuators are ideal for positioning applications, while rotary actuators excel in angular control systems.

## What are the key performance specifications to consider when selecting servo actuators?

Critical specifications include force/torque output, position accuracy (≤0.1mm for linear, ≤0.1° for rotary), dynamic response bandwidth (≥15-30 Hz for high-speed applications), and repeatability. You must also consider stroke length for linear actuators and angular range for rotary actuators.

## How do I determine the required force or torque for my application?

For linear actuators, calculate the maximum static and dynamic loads, including acceleration forces (F=ma), and apply a safety factor of 1.5-2.0x. For rotary actuators, consider load inertia, required angular acceleration, friction torque, and external loads like wind or gravity forces.

## What accuracy levels are achievable with precision servo actuators?

High-precision actuators achieve ≤0.1mm position accuracy for linear motion and ≤0.1° for rotary motion. Standard precision units offer ≤0.25mm or ≤0.25° accuracy, while industrial-grade actuators typically provide ≤0.5mm or ≤0.5° accuracy depending on the application requirements.

## What environmental factors affect servo actuator selection?

Key environmental considerations include operating temperature range (-40°C to +85°C standard, -55°C to +125°C military grade), shock resistance (>200g for 6ms), vibration tolerance (6.06g RMS over 20Hz-2000Hz), and protection against contamination with IP65/IP67 sealing ratings.

## Which servo actuators are recommended for aerospace and defense applications?

For aerospace and defense, the K-JD-XZ60D200 series linear actuators and K-JD-ZX10D040 series rotary actuators are recommended. These provide high reliability (MTBF >100,000 hours), precision control with sub-degree accuracy, MIL-STD compliance, and optimized power-to-weight ratios for space-constrained applications.

## What are the typical applications for linear servo actuators?

Linear servo actuators are commonly used in guided weapon systems for enhanced stability, aerospace control systems requiring reliable operation, precision positioning applications, and industrial automation where straight-line motion control is needed with high accuracy and repeatability.

## What are the typical applications for rotary servo actuators?

Rotary servo actuators excel in fin actuation for trajectory control, seeker gimbal positioning, control surface adjustment, attitude control systems, antenna positioning, and any application requiring precise angular positioning with high torque output and fast response times.

## How do power requirements vary between different servo actuator types?

Power consumption varies significantly: high-power applications may require 110V or 220V AC/DC, standard systems typically use 12V, 24V, or 48V DC, while low-power designs can operate on 5V logic-compatible supplies. Peak power occurs during acceleration, with lower continuous and standby power requirements.

## What control interface options are available for servo actuators?

Servo actuators support various control interfaces including analog control (±10V position command, 4-20mA current loop, PWM), digital communication (CAN bus, RS-485 serial, Ethernet/IP), and custom protocols. The choice depends on system integration requirements and communication infrastructure.

## What feedback systems are used in precision servo actuators?

Common feedback systems include optical encoders for high resolution in clean environments, magnetic encoders for harsh conditions, potentiometric sensors for cost-effective applications, and LVDT/RVDT systems for high accuracy and robust operation. Resolution ranges from <1,000 to >10,000 counts depending on precision requirements.

## How do I select between different actuator models for my specific application?

Selection depends on application type and requirements: aerospace/defense applications need high precision (≤0.1°) and extreme environment capability ($10K-50K range), industrial precision requires medium performance (≤0.25°) with standard environments ($5K-15K), while commercial systems prioritize cost-effectiveness with moderate precision (≤0.5°) in the $1K-5K range.

## What are the key integration considerations for servo actuators?

Critical integration factors include proper mechanical mounting with alignment fixtures, stress relief for thermal expansion, appropriate vibration isolation, and correct coupling methods. Control system integration requires proper PID tuning, bandwidth matching between actuator and controller, and optimization for stability margins and tracking accuracy.

## What maintenance and reliability factors should be considered?

Consider duty cycle requirements (continuous vs. intermittent operation), maintenance accessibility (sealed vs. serviceable designs), environmental protection needs, and expected operational life. High-reliability applications may require redundant systems and extended maintenance intervals, especially in aerospace and marine environments.
